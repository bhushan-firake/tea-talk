Points:

1.Aim: It is written for a professional programmer. My aim is to show you how to do refactoring in a
  controlled and efficient manner. You will learn to refactor in such a way that you don't 
  introduce bugs into the code but instead methodically improve the structure.
  
2.Topics Covered: Refactorings, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing,
  refactoring research & tools etc.
  
3.Your class library works, but could it be better? This book shows how refactoring can make 
  object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design 
  know-how, but once methodology is understood & tools become available, all programmers should be able 
  to improve their code using refactoring techniques.
